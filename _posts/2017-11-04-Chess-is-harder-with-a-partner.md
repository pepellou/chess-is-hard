Some people think chess is an individual game and many chess players actually
would prefer to be left alone when they're focuesd on a specific chess position.

But it's been proved by experience that playing chess along with a partner can
really be a lot of fun. We've experienced that in our classes.

It's true that at some moments chess is harder when your partner does not think the same as you:

But sometimes the fact that two different minds work together ensures a creative outcome:

And you finally get to the point where you can even control the outcome:

That been said, I have to say to [@kuartillo](https://twitter.com/kuartillo){:target="_blank"}
that we're still far from getting the most fun of it. Maybe some day we can reach the level of
fun brought by Bikfoot and RVK:

But we're on the good track!
