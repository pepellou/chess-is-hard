After a 1-week break we've resumed today our weekly sessions of "learning chess with [@kuartillo](https://twitter.com/kuartillo){:target="_blank"}"
and it turns out that our audience had a lot of fun (at least they clipped a lot!).

It's nice to see that because we experienced some technical issues with our stream health and we
were concerned that those problems would outshine [@kuartillo](https://twitter.com/kuartillo){:target="_blank"}'s come back.

I just want to share with you the funniest moments our audience clipped today. Apparently most of them were my faces!


My face watching a misplayed advance Caro-Kahn:

And last but not least, the moment were we solved our technical issues once and for all (or maybe not):

As a bonus, a popular clip that I hadn't seen from my last tactics session. The title by 
[@c_colombo](https://www.twitch.tv/c_colombo){:target="_blank"} says it all: **"ah yes, [chess code garble] that's what i was thinking as well"**:
